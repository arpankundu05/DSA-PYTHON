ii. ""Roadmap to learn DSA in Python""

1. Understand the Basics of Python
    ● Data types
    ● Control structures
    ● OOP concepts
    ● Libraries

2. Learn Problem-Solving Strategies
    ● Divide problems into smaller steps.
    ● Learn time complexity (Big-O notation) and space complexity.

3. Master Python’s Built-in Data Structures
    ● List: Dynamic arrays
    ● Tuple: Immutable sequences
    ● Set: Unordered collections with no duplicates
    ● Dict: Key-value pairs (hash maps)
    ● Deque: Double-ended queue
    ● Practice problems: Array operations, subarrays, hash maps, etc.

4. Learn Core Data Structures
    ● Arrays:
        Concepts: Traversals, sorting, searching
        Practice: Two-pointer techniques, sliding window problems
    ● Linked Lists:
        Types: Singly, Doubly, Circular
        Practice: Reversing a linked list, detecting cycles
    ● Stacks and Queues:
        Use cases: Expression evaluation, parentheses matching
        Practice: Implement stack/queue using lists or collections.deque
    ● Trees:
        Types: Binary trees, Binary Search Trees (BST), N-ary trees
        Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order
        Practice: Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA), Tree Diameter, Balanced Trees
    ● Graphs:
        Representations: Adjacency list/matrix
        Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Prim’s
        Practice: Shortest paths, connected components
    ● Heaps:
        Min-heap and Max-heap (heapq in Python)
        Practice: K largest elements, merging sorted arrays

5. Explore Core Algorithms
    ● Searching and Sorting
        Binary Search
        Merge Sort, Quick Sort
        Practice: Rotated arrays, nearest elements
    ● Recursion and Backtracking
        Understand recursion basics and memoization
        Practice: N-Queens, permutations, combinations
    ● Dynamic Programming
        Learn overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
        Practice: Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
    ● Greedy Algorithms
        Use cases: Interval problems, Huffman coding
        Practice: Activity selection, coin change
    ● Divide and Conquer
        Concept: Divide problems into smaller subproblems and merge results
        Practice: Merge Sort, Closest Pair of Points
    ● Graph Algorithms
        Topological Sorting
        Shortest Paths: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford
