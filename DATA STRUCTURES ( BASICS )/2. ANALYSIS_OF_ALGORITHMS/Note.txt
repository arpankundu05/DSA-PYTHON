i. What is meant by Algorithm Analysis?

Algorithm analysis is the process of evaluating an algorithm's efficiency in terms of time and space.
    ● Time complexity measures how fast the algorithm runs as the input size grows.
    ● Space complexity measures how much memory the algorithm uses.

ii. Why Analysis of Algorithms is important?

The analysis of algorithms is important because it helps us:
    ● Evaluate Efficiency: Understand how fast and memory-efficient an algorithm is.
    ● Choose the Best Option: Select the right algorithm for a specific problem.
    ● Handle Scalability: Ensure the algorithm performs well with large inputs.
    ● Optimize Performance: Improve software speed and resource usage.
